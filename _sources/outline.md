# Outline
The [overview]() already specified it, but just to be sure: the course will be split into two distinct parts. While the first half will consist of going through important `basics in writing re-executable publications`, the second half will entail working through a hands-on example to provide participants with first practical experience regarding the introduced concepts. As mentioned before, this `Jupyter Book` will contain all materials utilized in the course.

### When and where do we meet?

As mentioned in the [overview]() section, the course will take place via two distinct options: in-person, 19/06/2002, 1-5 PM BST & virtually. The respective links will be provided for registered participants shortly before the course.

### Schedule
In general, we will aim for a 5 h course. The content of the respective sessions will span everything from `interactive lectures` to `hands-on tutorials` and will in-parts entail a mixture of the two. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

💡 - input from the instructor(s)   
👩🏽‍🏫 - instructor(s) presents content    
👨🏻‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - hands-on computational work (e.g., coding)      
  

Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows (all times in CET):
